Mike here. I once saw a parade of bunnies out in the wild. 
Seriously, there were like five of them, each one chasing the bunny ahead of it. 
They went around like this for several minutes: jumping over things, going in and
around objects, all single file at high speed.
Needless to say, it was hilarious.
